## [**NcmModel**]({% link manual/NcmModel.html %})

In this tutorial series we discuss the complete analysis cycle, from
the abstract model implementation to the MCMC runs. This series starts 
with the introduction of the [abstract model concept]({% link tutorials/curve_tutorial_1.md %}).

The objective is to teach how to write in *C* a full set of objects representing
the models, data and how to use the statistical analysis tools in NumCosmo.

In the next weeks we will publish the subsequent parts of this tutorial 
series.
