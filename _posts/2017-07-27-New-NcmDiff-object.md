## [**NcmDiff**]({% link manual/NcmDiff.html %})

A new object NcmDiff was created to organize all numerical differentiation
code in NumCosmo. The library was updated in order to use this object
instead of the old ncm_numdiff* functions. We will soon finish the Fisher
matrix code, in addition of the already implemented observed Fisher matrix
code in [**NcmFit**]({% link manual/NcmFit.html %}).
